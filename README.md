# An asynchronous python client SDK for OSS(Aliyun Object Storage Service).
It has been verified and used in the production environment with QPS â‰ˆ 500  for about half a year, so you can use it with confidence.

# Installation
## PyPI (recommend)
```shell script
$ pip install asyncio-oss
```

## Local compilation
```shell script
$ git clone git@github.com:Yaocool/async-oss.git
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
$ pip install ./dist/asyncio_oss-*-py3-none-any.whl
```

# Examples
For more examples, please refer to the [test](./asyncio_oss/test) directory.
```python
import logging

import asyncio_oss
import asyncio
import oss2

OSS_ENDPOINT = 'https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com'  # definition in https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/31837.html
OSS_KEY = '<Your AccessKeyID>'
OSS_SECRET = '<Your AccessKeySecret>'
OSS_AUTH = oss2.Auth(OSS_KEY, OSS_SECRET)
BUCKET_NAME = '<your bucket name>'
OBJECT_KEY = '<your object key>'


async def main():
    async with asyncio_oss.Bucket(OSS_AUTH, OSS_ENDPOINT, BUCKET_NAME) as bucket:
        # Put Object
        await bucket.put_object(OBJECT_KEY, b'your bytes data')

        # Get Object
        result = await bucket.get_object(OBJECT_KEY)
        await result.read()
        
        # Head Object
        head_res = await bucket.head_object(OBJECT_KEY)
        print(head_res.content_length)
        
        # List Objects
        for obj in (await bucket.list_objects()).object_list:
            print(obj.key)

        # Delete Object
        await bucket.delete_object(OBJECT_KEY)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # open global log
    log_file_path = "example_logfile.log"
    asyncio_oss.set_file_logger(log_file_path, 'asyncio_oss', logging.DEBUG)
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```
